# angularJS-route-listing

Route Listing

Prerequisite

⚠️ This exercise requires that you have completed the Route Routing exercise.

Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/modern-framework/route-listing && cd $_

Requirements

In this exercise you will add a default view to your Routes of America application.

Add an additional route to your application that will load a listing view.
The listing view simply shows two hyperlinks that route the user to the two routes you built previously.
Add an otherwise configuration option to your routing.

Start http-server and access both of the existing routes and verify that they still work. Then verify that the base route works.

This route shows the list: http://localhost:8080/#/
